What I learnt in this project:
1. timescale <time_unit>/<time_precision>
2. parameterized module #()();
3. localparam -> Fixed value internally i.e. inside the module and can not be changed outside the module.
4. `<=`: non-blocking assignment operator: Schedules assignment concurrently rather than parallelly.
